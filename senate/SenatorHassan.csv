IMPORTANT READ from NH Health Care Assoc. CEO Brendan Williams: #GrahamCassidy is an attack on those on Medicaid:http://bit.ly/2xgmBQG ,2017-09-18 21:38:47,22,36,909894495013101568
Bottom-line: The #GrahamCassidy bill is just as dangerous as prior attempts to repeal the ACA & we must stop it in its tracks,2017-09-18 20:31:31,711,376,909877569364914176
"10)This bill has been introduced in the midst of bipartisan efforts to strengthen the individual insurance market, putting that work at risk",2017-09-18 20:31:13,45,34,909877491954839552
"9) Like prior versions of #Trumpcare, this #GrahamCassidy bill targets women's health and bars state reimbursements to Planned Parenthood",2017-09-18 20:30:38,47,48,909877346697715712
"8) It guts the requirement that insurers must cover essential health benefits like substance use disorder, mental health & maternity care",2017-09-18 20:30:23,43,42,909877282969411584
"7) It would allow insurers to hike people’s premiums the moment they get sick, even if they've been paying while healthy for years",2017-09-18 20:30:05,42,44,909877206939299843
6) This bill would lead to higher out-of-pocket costs & take away premium assistance from millions of hard-working people,2017-09-18 20:29:49,54,47,909877138467278849
5) #GrahamCassidy also undermines protections for people with pre-existing conditions,2017-09-18 20:29:35,42,38,909877079092670465
4) It cuts over $410 million dollars in federal funding for Medicaid to NH by 2026,2017-09-18 20:29:10,39,27,909876976470695936
3) These massive Medicaid cuts would also lead to funding cuts for school districts and students with disabilities,2017-09-18 20:28:48,40,39,909876885454278656
2) It caps and cuts Medicaid for seniors and people who experience disabilities – putting community-based care programs at risk,2017-09-18 20:28:23,54,47,909876780747694080
"1) It ends Medicaid expansion, which experts have called the #1 tool at our disposal to combat the opioid crisis",2017-09-18 20:28:04,54,44,909876699218812931
#GrahamCassidy health care repeal would be devastating for millions of Americans & we cannot let it pass. Here are a few of the reasons why:,2017-09-18 20:27:15,236,180,909876494398304256
