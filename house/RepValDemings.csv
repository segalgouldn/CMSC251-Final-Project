I am ready for the fight. We must do everything we can to #ProtectACAhttps://twitter.com/justincox/status/820009597385801729 …,2017-01-13 20:52:40,10,2,820010700760379392
Every person has a right to receive quality health care. Repealing the #ACA without a replacement plan is both destructive and irresponsible,2017-01-13 20:40:53,12,2,820007732241694721
I voted to protect the #ACA. Repealing the #ACA is neither a Republican or Democratic issue. This is an American issue.,2017-01-13 20:39:02,24,7,820007270595657730
