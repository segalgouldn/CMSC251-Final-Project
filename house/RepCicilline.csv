These issues are too important for political gamesmanship. We need serious leaders who will put our country ahead of politics.,2016-06-12 19:42:24,20,14,742079624771829760

"And the failure to do so makes Congress complicit in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans. I mean, let's be honest here.",2016-06-12 19:39:38,307,111,742078927812759553
Congress is the only institution with the power to actually do something about this violence.,2016-06-12 19:38:48,268,120,742078718655365120
They are weapons of war. They have no place in our communities. And it shouldn't be easier to buy an AR-15 than it is to buy cold medicine.,2016-06-12 19:38:01,410,194,742078520424206337

It is infuriating that leaders in Congress have still done nothing to address how easy it is for a lone wolf terrorist to buy a gun.,2016-06-12 19:28:40,33,37,742076168145408000
"This is also a reminder that homegrown attacks a threat to our safety. We've seen that at Ft Hood, in Charleston, and now in Orlando.",2016-06-12 19:27:44,5,6,742075935109861376
Demonizing LGBT Americans only exacerbates hatred and intolerance. LGBT people aren't political wedge issues. We are human beings.,2016-06-12 19:25:40,22,25,742075414764498944

There is too much hatred in this country. You can't look at the TV today and conclude that we have full LGBT equality. We don't.,2016-06-12 19:14:04,34,30,742072496418082816
But mostly about what could possess someone to do something like this. I don't understand it and I don't think I ever will.,2016-06-12 19:13:00,8,9,742072226992816129
