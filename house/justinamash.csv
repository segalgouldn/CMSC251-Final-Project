People on all sides joined us to oppose this big-govt program under Pres. Obama. Sen. @RandPaul is right. Govt's role is to defend liberty.https://twitter.com/randpaul/status/902184919979438081 …,2017-08-28 18:08:52,920,336,902231523235069953

I represent the entire city of Grand Rapids. Surrounding areas are substantially more Republican. Several were carved out of the district.,2017-08-24 17:39:38,1,1,900774617098448896
Not from a statistical standpoint. Our district was gerrymandered to make it less Republican than it would be w/ more natural redistricting.,2017-08-24 16:30:40,29,2,900757257272664064

Situation you describe is possible under either view. Tyrants don't care about laws. But your view requires a good pres to violate Const'n.,2017-07-06 23:35:33,2,0,883107177208188929
"In both views, there would be court challenge. But my view is more consistent w/ constitutional structure, sep'n of powers, and basic logic.",2017-07-06 23:27:46,2,1,883105221332930561

Yes. I'm pointing out that the existence of a tariff affects prices even if no companies move. @BobMurphyEcon,2016-12-05 05:49:32,7,1,805650291945250816
No. American consumers are taxed even if no companies move. Tariff increases production costs & limits competition. This is basic economics.https://twitter.com/scottadamssays/status/805610534955401216 …,2016-12-05 04:14:16,1225,537,805626315810504704
