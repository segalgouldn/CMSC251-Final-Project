Excellent bipartisan FL delegation meeting this morning. All in agreement we will not support supplemental in current form. Must include relief for FL citrus and agriculture.,2017-11-30 14:59:04,6,6,936248218760904704

Good. The Court struck down fmr Director Cordray’s overreach in naming a successor. So much for #CFPB’s rich tradition of ignoring the will of the people and the rule of law. Now let's reform this unaccountable agency and prevent such a debacle from ever happening again.,2017-11-29 00:51:40,27,17,935672573307838465
