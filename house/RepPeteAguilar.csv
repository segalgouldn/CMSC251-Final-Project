And for that – they should be ashamed. #EndGunViolence #Enough,2016-06-16 16:33:04,6,2,743481529641353217
I was wrong. @HouseGOP has consistently & deliberately worked to prevent commonsense reform from even being discussed. #Enough,2016-06-16 16:32:45,12,6,743481451807641600
I’ve said before that @HouseGOP’s most significant action to curb gun violence has been to hold moments of silence... #Enough,2016-06-16 16:32:15,8,2,743481325714313216
And thoughts and prayers should not be used as a replacement for taking meaningful action to make our communities safer. #Enough,2016-06-16 16:31:54,7,5,743481237113868289
Thoughts & prayers are nice but they don’t stop rounds of bullets from an assault weapon that kills scores of innocent Americans. #Enough,2016-06-16 16:31:33,10,7,743481146500079616
Thoughts & prayers are nice but they don’t perform background checks on domestic abusers/convicted felons who want to kill. #Enough,2016-06-16 16:31:02,8,7,743481016979951617
Thoughts & prayers are nice but they don’t stop a suspected terrorist from buying a firearm. #Enough,2016-06-16 16:30:37,6,2,743480913523245056
