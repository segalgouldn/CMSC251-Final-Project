SSA’s Acting Chief Actuary said they need to be strategic – that a budget alone won’t solve this.,2017-09-06 15:28:30,1,0,905452656302358528
I asked SSA is the new plan is going to stop the cycle & how they can assure us that in 10 yrs we won't have another backlog.,2017-09-06 15:28:20,0,0,905452616146198528

Waiting nearly two years to get a hearing decision is too long!,2017-09-06 14:45:27,1,2,905441822104846336
Social Security needs a Senate-confirmed Commissioner who can lead the agency & focus on providing the service Americans expect & deserve,2017-09-06 14:08:34,1,2,905432539988467712

"Since ‘13, Social Security has only had an Acting Commissioner.",2017-09-06 14:08:02,0,1,905432406127206400
Social Security needs more than just a plan to fix this – it needs real leadership.  This is in large part a management problem.,2017-09-06 14:07:52,1,1,905432362787405828

The SSA must find ways to be more efficient & modernize the Disability Insurance program.,2017-09-06 14:07:23,2,2,905432241504911360
"This year, the SSA received an additional $90 million in funding to address the disability backlog.",2017-09-06 14:07:00,1,1,905432146143268869

This is in large part because Social Security continues to rely on outdated criteria to determine eligibility for disability benefits.,2017-09-06 14:06:06,1,2,905431920531660800
"Since ‘03, Social Security’s disability programs have been on the GAO’s high risk list…",2017-09-06 14:05:56,0,1,905431878131474438
