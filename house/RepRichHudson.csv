"My bill is a simple, common sense solution to the confusing hodgepodge of #ConcealedCarry reciprocity agreements between states.

Talk about misleading - that gun wouldn’t qualify under concealed carry. My bill would allow law-abiding concealed carry permit holders from NC to travel to other states with their concealed gun.
