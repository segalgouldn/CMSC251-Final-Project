# CMSC251-Final-Project
Final Project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: Naive Bayes Text Classification on the Twitter accounts of the United States 115th Congress.

### Done:
Acquisition of all Tweets for all known Twitter accounts for each member of the US House of Representatives and Senate as of the night of 30 November 2017.

### To Do:
* Check the CSV files.
...Do they all contain Tweets?
...Text cleaning.
* Train and tune the classifier.
* Create a web application using Flask?

### Inspiration & Resources:
* [US Congress associated Twitter accounts](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-05-23-congress-seed-list).
* [Trump Tweets](https://github.com/sashaperigo/Trump-Tweets), used for web-scraping Twitter instead of using its API.
