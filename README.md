# CMSC251-Final-Project
Final Project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: Clustering on the Twitter accounts of the United States 115th Congress.

### Done:
Acquisition of all Tweets for all known Twitter accounts for each member of the US House of Representatives and Senate as of the night of 30 November 2017, and everything else.

### Inspiration & Initial Resources:
* [US Congress associated Twitter accounts](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/posts/2017-05-23-congress-seed-list).
* [Trump Tweets](https://github.com/sashaperigo/Trump-Tweets), used for web-scraping Twitter instead of using its API.
